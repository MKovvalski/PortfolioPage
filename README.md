## About Project
Website is a second version of my portfolioPage. Inspired with flat design and built with usage of simple ES6 and Sass Webpack configuration.  Main focus of the code was to flex my Sass and RWD skills. I am most proud of contact form which neatly combines form validation and changing styles on its every step. 

## Installation 
- clone repository 
- npm install
- npm start (localhost: 3001)

## In future
I plan keep this website always up to date with my current skill level
